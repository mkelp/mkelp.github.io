## **Current Projects**

Berawal dari saya pengen memperbarui repo yang tua dari suatu organisasi, niatnya pengen rumat ulang nih, ternyata dari orginal reponya ada update, sekalian buat artikel deh, lebih kurang gambaranya seperti ini.

### Vehicle emission factors for area-wide mobile monitoring

On-road vehicle emissions are a significant source of outdoor air pollution which pose a severe human health risk, especially for those who live near busy roads. A city's vehicle fleet population can determine the levels of risk and exposure for residences as emissions differ for gasoline- vs. diesel-powered vehicles. For example, light-duty gasoline vehicles are the largest human source of carbon monoxide (CO) in the USA, but on-road diesel engines are estimated to be the single largest human source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and an important on-road source of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Most research sampling mobile source emissions in urban traffic involve “vehicle chase” studies of exhaust plumes from individual vehicles which may not be representative of the average emissions for a given area.

We apply a statistical model (absolute principal components score; APCS) to measurements obtained from continuously moving platforms to estimate area-wide average vehicle emission factors of urban neighborhoods. These model predictions are used to estimate average, fuel-based emission factors by source-related features within a city. The pollutants we measured (PM2.5, BC, CO, CO2, and NOx) were chosen based on 1) the important contribution of traffic sources to these pollutant's emissions, 2) the relative importance of these species in distinguishing emissions from light-duty versus heavy-duty vehicles and 3) the recognized health effects of pollutant exposure. The APCS model can calculate separately light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emission factors for a study area while also separating out high-emitter vehicles that may artificially skew emission factor estimates. Study areas include Los Angeles, USA and Chengdu, China.


### Indoor air pollution from cookstove intervention in rural South India

Biomass combustion in residential cookstoves is a major source of indoor air pollution and a large contributor to the global burden of disease. Investment of resources into rural energy intervention programs has great potential to improve household air quality in developing countries and thus increase quality of life, improve public health, and address climate change. We conducted a randomized intervention study to evaluate air pollution impacts of a carbon-finance-approved cookstove in rural South India. We employed real-time monitors to measure indoor concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in households using newer, carbon-finance-approved stoves and households continuing to use traditional open fire stoves. Implementation of the carbon-finance-approved cookstoves decreased concentrations of CO and PM2.5 but increased BC concentration during cooking-relevant hours-of-day relative to the traditional open fire stoves.

Although laboratory studies have clearly demonstrated the potential benefits of cookstove interventions, demonstrating these same benefits in real households has proven to be more complex. This work suggests that reduction in indoor pollution from intervention cookstoves might not be occurring in practice to the same extent as is expected from laboratory evaluation, and that unilateral benefits from such interventions should not be assumed.


### Measuring coal dust from trains in the Columbia River Gorge, Washington State

Trains powered by diesel fuel travel through the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area as well as many urban areas in Washington State. Evaluating the air quality impacts from rail traffic for people living near rail lines is hampered by a lack of data. Emission standards for new and remanufactured locomotives have decreased steadily over the past several decades. Because of the lack of information on PM2.5 concentrations and the exposure to humans from diesel trains, the debate over coal dust, and the scarcity of information on diesel train emissions, we sought to measure these air quality effects

We examined the emissions of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and coal dust from trains in the Columbia River Gorge in Washington State during summer 2014 and found that the passage of a diesel powered open-top coal train results in nearly twice as much respirable PM2.5 compared to the passage of a diesel-powered freight train not carrying coal in an open hopper. We also witnessed multiple “super-duster” events where the coal dust emissions led to visible dust plumes and the highest PM2.5 concentrations observed in our study.
