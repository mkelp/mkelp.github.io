## **Current Projects**

Berawal dari saya pengen memperbarui repo yang tua dari suatu organisasi, niatnya pengen rumat ulang nih, ternyata dari orginal reponya ada update, sekalian buat artikel deh, lebih kurang gambaranya seperti ini.

### Vehicle emission factors for area-wide mobile monitoring

On-road vehicle emissions are a significant source of outdoor air pollution which pose a severe human health risk, especially for those who live near busy roads. A city's vehicle fleet population can determine the levels of risk and exposure for residences as emissions differ for gasoline- vs. diesel-powered vehicles. For example, light-duty gasoline vehicles are the largest human source of carbon monoxide (CO) in the USA, but on-road diesel engines are estimated to be the single largest human source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and an important on-road source of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Most research sampling mobile source emissions in urban traffic involve “vehicle chase” studies of exhaust plumes from individual vehicles which may not be representative of the average emissions for a given area.


We apply a statistical model (absolute principal components score; APCS) to measurements obtained from continuously moving platforms to estimate area-wide average vehicle emission factors of urban neighborhoods. These model predictions are used to estimate average, fuel-based emission factors by source-related features within a city. The pollutants we measured (PM2.5, BC, CO, CO2, and NOx) were chosen based on 1) the important contribution of traffic sources to these pollutant's emissions, 2) the relative importance of these species in distinguishing emissions from light-duty versus heavy-duty vehicles and 3) the recognized health effects of pollutant exposure. The APCS model can calculate separately light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emission factors for a study area while also separating out high-emitter vehicles that may artificially skew emission factor estimates. Study areas include Los Angeles, USA and Chengdu, China.
