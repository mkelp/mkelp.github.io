#### Vehicle emission factors for area-wide mobile monitoring

On-road vehicle emissions are a significant source of outdoor air pollution which pose a severe human health risk, especially for those who live near busy roads. A city's vehicle fleet population can determine the levels of risk and exposure for residences as emissions differ for gasoline- vs. diesel-powered vehicles. Most research sampling mobile source emissions in urban traffic involve “vehicle chase” studies of exhaust plumes from individual vehicles which may not be representative of the average emissions for a given area.

We apply a statistical model (absolute principal components score; APCS) to measurements obtained from continuously moving platforms to estimate area-wide average vehicle emission factors of urban neighborhoods. These model predictions are used to estimate emission factors by source-related features within a city. The APCS model can calculate separately light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emission factors for a study area while also separating out high-emitter vehicles that may artificially skew emission factor estimates. Study areas include Los Angeles, USA and Chengdu, China.

#### Indoor air pollution from cookstove intervention in rural South India

Biomass combustion in residential cookstoves is a major source of indoor air pollution and a large contributor to the global burden of disease. Investment of resources into rural energy intervention programs has great potential to improve household air quality in developing countries and thus increase quality of life and improve public health. We conducted a randomized intervention study to evaluate air pollution impacts of a carbon-finance-approved cookstove in rural South India. We employed real-time monitors to measure indoor concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in households using carbon-finance-approved stoves and households continuing to use traditional open fire stoves. Implementation of the new cookstoves decreased concentrations of CO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> but increased BC concentrations relative to the traditional stoves.

Although lab studies have clearly demonstrated the potential benefits of cookstove interventions, demonstrating these same benefits in real households is more complex. This work suggests that reduction in indoor pollution from intervention cookstoves might not be occurring in practice to the same extent as is expected from lab evaluation, and that benefits from such interventions should not be assumed.

#### Measuring coal dust from trains in the Columbia River Gorge, WA

Trains powered by diesel fuel travel through the Columbia River Gorge as well as many urban areas in Washington State. Evaluating the air quality impacts from rail traffic for people living near rail lines is hampered by a lack of data. Emission standards for new and remanufactured locomotives have decreased steadily over the past several decades. Because of the lack of information on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and the exposure to humans from diesel trains, we sought to measure these air quality effects.

We examined the emissions of diesel particulate matter and coal dust from trains in the Columbia River Gorge during summer 2014 and found that the passage of a diesel powered open-top coal train results in nearly twice as much respirable PM<sub>2.5</sub> compared to the passage of a diesel-powered freight train not carrying coal. We also witnessed multiple “super-duster” events where the coal dust emissions led to visible dust plumes and the highest PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations observed in our study.

#### Actionable sampling: Heavy metals air quality monitoring in Portland, OR

Teaming up with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, I was an air quality sample assistant during the fall of 2015. I helped install and collect BGI filters and maintained an [EPA validated method sampling site](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBypsl_yBFwdpMGOHG97ZG_KQ9k5zbXS/view). We created [statewide attention](https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2016/02/03/arsenic-cadmium-levels-near-two-se-portland-schools-are-alarmingly-high-state-finds) towards elevated arsenic and cadmium concentrations near two schools (including a kindergarten) in SE Portland. We identified the source of the heavy metal pollution from the Bullseye Glass
Co. which then [suspended its use of chromium](https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2016/02/04/bullseye-glass-has-suspended-use-of-arsenic-and-cadmium-because-of-air-quality-concerns) in its products.
