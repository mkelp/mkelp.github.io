I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Daniel Jacob and Dr. Loretta Mickley in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](https://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University. My current research focuses on (1) using machine learning to expand the capabilities of atmospheric chemistry models, (2) developing dimensionality reduction algorithms that can determine the optimal and equitable placement of air quality sensors, (3) investigating the potential for prescribed fires to abate wildfire smoke exposures in the Western United States, and (4) quantifying impacts of chemical data assimilation on air pollution forecasts for NASA's GEOS Composition Forecasting model (GEOS-CF).

Before coming to Harvard, I worked as a junior research scientist at the University of Washington with Prof. Julian Marshall on air quality case studies and applications of machine learning methods to chemical mechanisms. I earned my B.A. in chemistry from Reed College, with research experience pertaining to air pollution monitoring and secondary organic aerosol modeling. In my spare time, I [play jazz trombone](https://soundcloud.com/philosophytalk/it-dont-mean-a-thing-from-your-lying-eyes-112915){:target="_blank"}, enjoy football/basketball, and watch horror movies.
