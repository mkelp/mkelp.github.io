###  I am interested in applying data-driven science to lift barriers in atmospheric chemistry modeling and air pollution monitoring. 

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Daniel Jacob in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University. The main goal of my current research is to leverage machine learning to emulate the expensive chemical solvers found in global atmospheric chemistry models for purposes of computational speedup and improved pollutant forecasting. In addition, I work on optimizing sensor placement for air pollution monitoring.

Before coming to Harvard, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Washington with Prof. Julian Marshall on the application of machine learning methods to chemical mechanisms. I earned my B.A. in Chemistry from Reed College, with research experience pertaining to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) modeling using the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. In my spare time, I watch horror films, enjoy basketball, and [play jazz trombone](https://soundcloud.com/philosophytalk/it-dont-mean-a-thing-from-your-lying-eyes-112915){:target="_blank"}.
