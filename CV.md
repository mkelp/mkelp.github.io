###  I am interested in applying data-driven science to lift barriers in atmospheric chemistry modeling and air pollution monitoring.

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student working with Prof. Daniel Jacob in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University. I focus on using machine learning to expand the capabilties of atmospheric chemistry models, and developing modal decomposition techniques to determine the optimal placement of air quality sensors.

Before coming to Harvard, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Washington with Prof. Julian Marshall on the application of machine learning methods to chemical mechanisms. I earned my B.A. in Chemistry from Reed College, with research experience pertaining to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) modeling using the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. In my spare time, I watch horror films, enjoy basketball, and [play jazz trombone](https://soundcloud.com/philosophytalk/it-dont-mean-a-thing-from-your-lying-eyes-112915){:target="_blank"}.
